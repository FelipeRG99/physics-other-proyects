repo where i post small projects related to physics or other similar things when i am bored (very bored XD)

# Physics

# [Heat distributions üî•](Heat_distributions) 

Simulation numerically and analitically of hte heat distributuion resolving the differential equations and more. Here you can find the resolution both numerically, for 1D and 2D, and analitically for a specific cases in 1D. Of course you can see the heat distribution in real time and download it.

# [N-body problem ü™ê](N_body) 

This contains the resolution of the N-body problem using the BDF method to resolve the ODE (ordinary diferential equations) system, specificaly using the function from scipy.integrate, solve_ivp. Also uses the Horizon API from NASA to get real data to use in the simulation. The results achieved are great, for example, in a 4 body problem, Sun-Earth-Moon-Jupiter, in forecast of 350 days the errors are less than 3% compared to the real data.
