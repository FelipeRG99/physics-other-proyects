Simulation of the differential equations of the heat distribitutions.

# Heat simulation ðŸ”¥

Simulation numerically and analitically of hte heat distributuion resolving the differential equations and more. In the [Notebooks](Notebooks) you can find the resolution both numerically, for 1D and 2D, and analitically for a specific cases in 1D.        

Whit the scripts of [1D](heat_equation_1D.py) and [2D](heat_equation_2D.py) you can see the animation of these results and if you want to download it in mp4 format (you must have ffmpeg installed and in path to do this, if not, save it as .gif). The results can be seen [here](results).

Each simulation supports diferent boundary conditions. When you generate a simulation you can do it ploting each second of the simulation as real second (real time) or ploting each frame as a iteration in the simulation (this last longer).
